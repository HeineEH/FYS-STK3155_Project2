## Project description

In this project, we investigate feed forward neural networks. In particular, we do a regression analysis on data taken from the one dimensional Runge function and a classification analysis on the MNISt dataset. In the case of regression, we investigate different training methods, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and ordinary gradient descent (GD), with both the Adam and RMSprop algorithms. We optimize the model architecture (given by the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes, as well as the activation functions used) in order to minimize the cost function. Moreover, we investigate whether $L_1$ or $L_2$ regularization improves model performance. With our analysis, one gains a better understanding of the performance of neural networks, as well as how they should be trained.
